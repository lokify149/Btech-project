This project focuses on the development of an IoT-based smart energy 
monitor using a Raspberry Pi. The objective is to create a system that can monitor 
and analyze energy consumption in real-time, providing users with valuable 
insights into their energy usage patterns. By leveraging the capabilities of the 
Raspberry Pi, along with additional sensors and communication modules, the 
energy monitor collects data from various sources, such as electricity meters and 
smart plugs. The collected data is then processed and visualized using a web
based interface, allowing users to track their energy consumption, set energy
saving goals, and receive notifications or alerts for abnormal usage. The IoT 
aspect enables remote monitoring and control, enabling users to access and 
manage the system from anywhere using their smart phones or other devices. 
This project showcases the potential of Raspberry Pi and IoT technologies in 
creating energy-efficient solutions and promoting sustainable practices.
